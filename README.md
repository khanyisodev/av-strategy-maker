# Strategy Maker

WordPress plugin displaying a bankroll simulation with a dark UI. It visualizes several betting strategies (fixed, martingale,
dynamic, guarded martingale) using preloaded multipliers. The interface includes controls for speed, window size, cashout and a
reset button, while dataset visibility can be toggled via the chart legend. Embed the UI in posts or pages using the
`[strategy_maker]` shortcode.
